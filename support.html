            <h1>Support and help available</h1>
            <p>It can be hard to get support and help so here are a few suggestions about
               support groups that can help men with their mental and physical health.</p>

                <li><b>Directions for Men:</b>  This organization provides support groups for men to come 
                    and talk about whatever is affecting their mental health. They also organize activities
                    and events for men to attend and participate in. Their approach is called peer support,
                    which means people with similar backgrounds and experiences look out for each other. 
                    They offer ongoing support for emotional wellbeing with preventative check-ins and
                    longer-term follow-up. They also provide personalized care, including as many mental
                    health care options as possible, talking therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy,
                    and mindfulness. They have casual meet-ups with others who have a mental health condition,
                    where they can help each other and talk about their issues. You can reach out to them 
                    through their website <a href="https://www.directionsformen.org.uk/">Directions for Men</a>

                <li><b>Men's Peer Support Directory:</b>  Mind is a mental health charity in England and Wales 
                    that provides information and advice to people with mental health problems. They have a
                    directory of over 300 mental health peer support groups in England and Wales. You can find 
                    more information on their website<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/peer-support-directory/">Peer Support Directory</a>

                <br>          
                <li><b>Online Support Groups:</b>  Online men’s groups are safe spaces where people,
                     especially men, can share issues related to depression, anxiety, alcoholism, eating 
                     disorders, or stress from the privacy of their homes. Online support groups can serve
                      as support systems or as therapeutic components of a mental health treatment plan.
