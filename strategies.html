            <h1>Strategies for moving on positively</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Connect with other people:  </b>Good relationships are important for your mental wellbeing. 
                        They can help you to build a sense of belonging and self-worth, provide emotional support, 
                        and allow you to support others. Try to take time each day to be with your family, 
                        arrange a day out with friends you have not seen for a while, or visit a friend or 
                        family member who needs support or company.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Be physically active:  </b>Being active is not only great for your physical health and fitness,
                        but it can also improve your mental wellbeing by raising your self-esteem, helping you to
                        set goals or challenges and achieve them, and causing chemical changes in your brain 
                        which can help to positively change your mood. Try to find activities you enjoy and
                        make them a part of your life.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Learn new skills:  </b>Learning new skills can also improve your mental wellbeing by boosting
                        self-confidence and raising self-esteem, helping you to build a sense of purpose, and 
                        helping you to connect with others. Try learning to cook something new, taking on a new 
                        responsibility at work, or working on a DIY project.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Get enough sleep:  </b>Sleep is essential for good mental and physical health. It helps to 
                        regulate mood, reduce stress, and improve cognitive function. Try to get at least 7-8 hours 
                        of sleep each night.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Eat a balanced diet:  </b>Eating a balanced and healthy diet is important for maintaining good 
                        physical and mental health. Try to eat a variety of foods from all the major food groups, 
                        including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Manage stress:  </b>Stress can have a negative impact on both your mental and physical health. 
                        Try to identify the sources of stress in your life and find ways to manage them. This could 
                        include practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, or engaging 
                        in activities that you enjoy.
                    </li>
